# Processing Library Scratch Demos

Additional to the examples, which are included in the [library](https://github.com/mikebarkmin/processing-library-scratch), you can find more projects in this repository. I sorted the projects by processing mode [Java](./java) and [Python](./python). 
If you have an example which you would like to add, please submit a pull request.
